# crawler

The certcat crawler pulls data from sources like Certificate Transparency, CRLs, OCSP and root programs.

The data is stored in a machine-readable format suitable for use by downstream systems who want to understand the Web PKI.

This project is still an experiment and is not yet intended for public use or collaboration.
